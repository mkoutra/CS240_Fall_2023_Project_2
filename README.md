## CS-240: Data structures, Fall 2023-2024
Project 2 for the Data Structures class [CS-240](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy240/current/en/index.php) implemented in C. 

Key objectives of the project include:

- Implementation of essential data structures such as binary search trees, heaps, stacks, queues, singly and doubly linked lists etc.
  
- Construction of more complex data structures, including leaf-oriented binary search trees, to handle sophisticated data organization requirements.
  
- Development of optimized algorithms to manipulate and manage data within these structures efficiently.
  
- Exploration of various algorithms for common operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting, ensuring both correctness and performance.

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a streamlined movie streaming service that offers a curated selection of movies categorized into various genres. Users will have the ability to register for the service, browse the available movie catalog, and watch movies by adding them to their viewing history. Additionally, the service will provide basic statistics based on the movie ratings.

#### Note
The `main.c`, `Makefile`,`Movie.h`, and several test files are accessible to the public via the course website, which can be found [here](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy240/current/en/exercises.php).
